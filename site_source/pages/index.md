# About me

I'm currently studying the [Data Science and AI](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence) bachelor’s at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). I’m also doing an internship with [i-Med Technology](https://www.i-medtech.nl/), where I’m developing and implementing various image processing techniques for a digital surgical loupe.

I’m half Japanese, half British, and I've lived in the UK, Japan, Spain, and the Netherlands. I can speak English, Spanish, and Japanese.

## Interests

- **[Programming](projects.md)**  
  In my free time, I mostly code in C, Python, Lua, and various other languages, depending on the goal. The topics I'm most interested in are image processing, GPU computing, and small utility tools.

- **[Photography](photos.md)**  
  I've taken many photos in various countries over the last few years. I mostly take photos of landscapes, plants, and animals.

- **Art**  
  I like to paint landscapes, generally using oil paint, water paint, or just black pen.

- **Remote-controlled planes**  
  This includes designing and building them, as well as, of course, flying them.
