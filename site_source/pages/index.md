# About me

I was born in the UK, and I've lived in Spain, Japan, and the Netherlands. I can speak English, Spanish, and Japanese. I'm currently studying the [Data Science and AI](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence) bachelor at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

As part of an internship, I'm currently working two days a week at [I-Med Technology](https://www.i-medtech.nl/), a company developing a digital surgical loupe. At I-Med, I develop and implement various image processing techniques for the digital loupe.

## Interests

- **Programming**  
  In my free time, I mostly code in C, Python, Lua, and various other languages, depending on the goal. The topics and most interested in are image processing, GPU computing, and also making small utility tools.

  This includes designing and building them, as well as, of course, flying them.
