# About me

I'm currently studying the [Data Science and AI](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence) bachelor’s at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). I’m also doing an internship with [I-Med Technology](https://www.i-medtech.nl/), where I’m developing and implementing various image processing techniques for a digital surgical loupe.

I’m half Japanese, half British, and I've lived in the UK, Japan, Spain, and the Netherlands. I can speak English, Spanish, and Japanese.

## Interests

- **[Programming](projects.md)**  
  In my free time, I mostly code in C, Python, Lua, and various other languages, depending on the goal. The topics and most interested in are image processing, GPU computing, and also making small utility tools.

- **[Photography](photos.md)**  
  I've take many photos in various contries over the last few years. I mostly take landscape photos, and photos of plants and animals.

- **Art**  
  I like to paint landscapes, generally using oil paint, water paint, or just black pen.

- **Remote-controlled planes**  
  This includes designing and building them, as well as, of course, flying them.
